        <p>I am a Software Engineer with a curiosity for everything code related. My ability to continuously learn and increment new tools into my work is a huge part of my Software Engineering journey. My skills with JavaScript and Python allow me to pull information from any API, and so I've instrumented these languages with frameworks like React and Django. Working with a team always plays to my strengths but I'm always willing to take on challenges on my own. On my own I know I'm all I've got, so my attention to detail is even more heightened.</p>
